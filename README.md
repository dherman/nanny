Rust bindings for writing safe and fast native Node.js modules.

# Getting started

Once you have the [platform dependencies](https://guides.neon-bindings.com/getting-started/) installed, getting started is as simple as:

```
$ npm install -g neon-cli
$ neon new my-project
```

See the [Getting Started guide](https://guides.neon-bindings.com/getting-started/) for details.

# Platform Support

### Operating Systems

| Linux  | macOS | Windows |
| ------ | ----- | ------- |
| ✓      | ✓     | ✓       |

### Node.js

| Node 4 | Node 6 | Node 7 | Node 8 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| ✓      | ✓      | ✓      | ✓      |

Support for [LTS versions of Node](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule) and current are expected. If you're using a different version of Node and believe it should be supported, let us know.

### Rust

Neon supports Rust stable version 1.18 and higher. We test on the latest stable, beta, and nightly versions of Rust.

# A Taste...

A Neon function takes a `Call` object and produces a Rust `Result` that's either a JS value or the `Throw` constant (meaning a JS exception was thrown). The `Call` object provides access to a memory management scope, which safely manages the routing of handles to heap objects:

```rust
fn make_an_array(call: Call) -> JsResult<JsArray> {
    let scope = call.scope; // the current scope for rooting handles
    let array: Handle<JsArray> = JsArray::new(scope, 3);
    array.set(0, JsNumber::new(scope, 9000))?;
    array.set(1, JsNumber::new(scope))?;
    array.set(2, JsNumber::new(scope, 3.14159))?;
    Ok(array)
}
```
